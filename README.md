# Code and Data for "Decision-Making and Optimal Foraging: The Role of Patch Exploitation Models"

This repository contains the raw data as well as R scripts for the two experiments. 
The preprint for the article is available online (**URL**).

## Content

The raw data files are 'Data_For_I.csv' (for Experiment 1) and 'Data_For_Intensive_Work.csv' (for Experiment 2). Analysis scripts 'Experiment 1.R' and 'Experiment 2.R' include all analysis steps, i.e. data preprocessing, descriptive and inference statistical analyses as well as generation of figures. 

## Usage

To install all packages in the versions used for analysis, run `renv::restore()` (and activate `renv` if neccessary). Then, renv will install all required packages that are used in the analysis scripts. 
Alternatively, the analysis script will invoke installation of required packages (in the current CRAN version) when run.
